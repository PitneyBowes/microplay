# MicroPlay

A shared library with common toolset for all Play based RESTfull micro services in borderfree 
This library is not intended as a seed/scaffold project, so copy-pasting is discouraged

#### Main Features

- Base REST API Controller `com.borderfree.microplay.controllers.components.ApiControllerActions` supporting:
    - cross-thread request context tracking in logs with a correlation id. injected for any `apiAction` in controllers inheriting from `ApiControllerActions`.  implementation: `com.borderfree.microplay.logging.MDCManager`, `com.borderfree.microplay.logging.MDCPropagatingDispatcherConfigurator`
    - json/xml content negotiation
    - catch all to json error handler
- HTTP trace filter. GZIP content negotiation filter
- swagger UI and swagger core integration
- exposes /health, /status API endpoints 
- Standard json based REST API consumer - `com.borderfree.microplay.services.RestApiConsumer`
- Objects to Json conversion utils. under `\app\com\borderfree\microplay\utils`   

#### Installation/Usage

 - Add the artifact generated by the library as an sbt dependency to your play build.sbt:
    ```scala
    "com.borderfree"  %% "microplay" % "2.6.7.1-1"
    or
    "com.borderfree"  %% "microplay" % "2.6.7.1-+"
    ```
    Find [latest versions](https://artifactory-dev.bfretail.pitneycloud.com/artifactory/libs-release-local/com/borderfree/microplay_2.12/)

- Your projects `application.conf` will inherit defaults from microplay `application.conf` - review overridable microplay default settings under 
  ```javascript
  micro {
      //microplay default settings....
  }
  
  ```
