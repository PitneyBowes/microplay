    - cross-thread request context tracking in logs with a correlation id. injected for any `apiAction` in controllers inheriting from `ApiControllerActions`.  implementation: `com.pb.microplay.logging.MDCManager`, `com.pb.microplay.logging.MDCPropagatingDispatcherConfigurator`
    - json/xml content negotiation
    - global error handlers returns json response
- HTTP trace filter. GZIP content negotiation filter
- swagger UI and swagger core integration
- exposes /health, /status /docs API endpoints 
- Standard json based REST API consumer - `com.pb.microplay.services.RestApiConsumer`
- Objects to Json conversion utils. under `\app\com\pb\microplay\utils`   

#### Installation/Usage
In sbt build file:
1. add JCenter repository resolver:
    ```scala
    resolvers += Resolver.jcenterRepo
    ```

2. sdd the library as an sbt dependency:   
    ```scala
    libraryDependencies += "com.pb"  %% "microplay" % "26.3.64"
    //or
    libraryDependencies += "com.pb"  %% "microplay" % "26.3.+"
    ```

- Your projects configuration will inherit default configuration from microplay [`application.conf`](/microplay-lib/conf/application.conf) - you can review and decide to override these settings under the `micro` node 
  ```javascript
  micro {
      //microplay default settings....
  }  
  ```
