## Contributing to Microplay 

Contributions are welcomed :)
Unless your intended contribution bares minor effort - it is highly recommended to start with [posting an issue](https://github.com/PitneyBowes/microplay/issues), describing the bug or feature request. A suggested solution can optionally be proposed as well, it's a good chance to get some feedback and perhaps trigger a discussion with other interested developers.

Try to keep this library generic as much as possible and stay away from implementations bound to specific providers. Try avoid adding more dependencies unless it results in a substantial added value. 

### Developing
Please add/update Unit Tests for new/updated functionality. Please adhere to commonly known Scala development best practices and code styling standards (I have no idea what that actually means, but it seems as the right thing to write here :) )
See if you find anything interesting on the [TODO list](./TODO.md).

### Building

The Project is managed by sbt. Import [build.sbt](./build.sbt) with your IDE of choice and from there, the rest is (hopefully) pretty standard.
